# Build Notes

## Current State

### ‚úÖ What's Ready:
- Official whisper.cpp as git submodule (properly configured)
- All Kotlin source files (TextProcessor, AudioRecorder, WhisperEngine, VoiceInputPipeline)
- JNI bridge for whisper.cpp
- Gradle build configuration
- Gradle wrapper included

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Requirements:

**You CANNOT build from command line without:**
1. **Android SDK** - Needs to be installed
2. **Android NDK** - Required to compile whisper.cpp native code (C++)
3. **CMake** - Required to build JNI libraries

**Solution: Use Android Studio**
1. Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
2. Android Studio will:
   - Auto-detect/download SDK
   - Install NDK (specified version 25.2.9519653)
   - Install CMake
   - Build native libraries
   - Compile Kotlin code

### üì¶ Git Submodule Setup:

whisper.cpp is now properly configured as a git submodule:
```bash
# Clone with submodules (for others)
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>

# Or initialize submodules after clone
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The submodule will NOT pollute our repo - it's tracked as a reference, not full files.

### üß™ What We CAN Test (Command Line):

**Kotlin Core Logic (no Android SDK needed):**
```bash
cd android
kotlinc verify_core_logic.kts -script
```

This tests:
- TextProcessor hallucination filtering
- Config validation
- Text overlap detection

### üöÄ What We CANNOT Test (Command Line):

- Building the app (needs SDK/NDK)
- Running unit tests (needs Android runtime)
- Compiling whisper.cpp JNI (needs NDK + CMake)
- Running on emulator/device

## Recommendation

**Open Android Studio and:**
1. File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select `android/` folder
2. Wait for Gradle sync (will download NDK/CMake)
3. Place a GGML model in `app/src/main/assets/models/`
4. Build ‚Üí Make Project
5. Run on device/emulator

This is the **only way** to properly build and test the Android app with native libraries.
