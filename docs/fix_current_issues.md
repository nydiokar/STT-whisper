# Issues 

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
Config System Mismatch
Standardize on the comprehensive core/config.py implementation
Remove the older config.py to avoid confusion
Ensure all components properly use the nested configuration structure
Missing Language Support Implementation
The UI allows language selection but the change isn't actually applied to the transcriber
Fix this to ensure the selected language is used for transcription
Error Handling Issues
Fix inconsistent error handling, especially in the transcription process
Add proper error propagation to prevent silent failures that could leave the app hanging

## Important Issues (Should Fix Soon)

Inconsistent Logger Naming
Standardize logger naming across all modules
Choose either "VoiceService.X" or "voice_input_service.core.X" format
UI Update Issues
Improve the UI update mechanism to avoid potential race conditions
Reduce redundant UI updates for better performance
TranscriptionWorker Buffering Logic
Make audio processing thresholds configurable
Ensure optimal performance across different hardware
Hardcoded Values
Move hardcoded timings and thresholds to the configuration system
This will make the app more adaptable to different environments

## Can Defer (Nice to Have)

Duplicated Logic for Text Processing
Extract text cleaning and formatting logic to utility functions
Not critical but would improve code maintainability
Continuous Mode User Experience
Improve how continuous mode handles the transition between recordings
Give users time to see what was transcribed before clearing
Event Handling Cleanup
Improve the cleanup mechanism for keyboard event handling
Current implementation works but could be more reliable
TranscriptionEngine Caching
Implement better caching for the Whisper model
Would improve startup time but not critical for functionality
Redundant Status Color Updates
Optimize status updates to reduce unnecessary UI refreshes
Purely an optimization issue

# Implementation Plan

## First Sprint: Fix all critical issues
Standardize config system
Implement proper language support
Fix error handling

## Second Sprint: Address important issues
Standardize logging
Fix UI update mechanism
Make processing thresholds configurable
Move hardcoded values to config

## Future Sprints: Address the deferred issues as time permits
