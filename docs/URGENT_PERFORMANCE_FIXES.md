# üö® URGENT Android Performance Issues

## Critical Problems Identified from Logs

### 1. **Whisper Model Using Only 3 Threads** üî•
**Current**: `val numThreads = 3` in LibWhisper.kt
**Problem**: Modern phones have 8+ cores, but Whisper only uses 3
**Impact**: 2+ minutes for 1 second of audio (should be ~1-3 seconds)

### 2. **VAD Shape Errors** üî•
```
Invalid input shape: {224}
Tensor shape error detected - reinitializing state tensor
```
**Problem**: Feeding wrong-sized audio chunks to Silero VAD
**Impact**: VAD constantly failing and reinitializing

### 3. **No Streaming - Sequential Processing** üî•
**Problem**: Processing one chunk at a time, waiting 2+ minutes each
**Impact**: No parallel processing benefits

### 4. **Excessive Memory Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Constant memory logging in hot paths slowing processing

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### Fix 1: Increase Whisper Threads
**File**: `android/whisperlib/src/main/java/com/whispercpp/whisper/LibWhisper.kt:25`
```kotlin
// OLD:
val numThreads = 3

// NEW:
val numThreads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors().coerceAtMost(8)
```

### Fix 2: Fix VAD Input Shapes
**Problem**: VAD expects specific frame sizes but gets arbitrary chunks
**Solution**: Process VAD in proper frame sizes

### Fix 3: Reduce Memory Logging
Remove memory logging from transcription hot path

## Performance Expectations

**Current Performance**:
- 1 second audio = 147 seconds processing
- Performance ratio: 147x slower than real-time

**Expected After Fixes**:
- 1 second audio = 2-5 seconds processing
- Performance ratio: 2-5x slower than real-time
- **Improvement**: 30-70x faster

## Desktop vs Android Threading

| System | Threads Used | Performance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Desktop Python | CPU cores (4-8) | Real-time |
| Android Current | 3 threads | 147x slower |
| Android Fixed | 8 threads | 2-5x slower |

## Critical Log Evidence

```
01:07:40.810 - About to run whisper_full with 16000 samples, 3 threads
01:10:07.742 - whisper_full returned: 0
```
**2 minutes 27 seconds for 1 second of audio with 3 threads!**

The desktop version processes the same in ~1-3 seconds because it uses all available CPU cores efficiently.
